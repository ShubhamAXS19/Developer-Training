# First Pull Request
Hello stranger!

This Repo is going to help you guide you through your first PR (Pull Request).

I've aslo been trying to find a repo where I can contribute and share my code with others, this repo is meant to help you first hand on what to do and how. 

This also assumes that you already know how to create a pull request if you don't no worries this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) can show you how.

Additionally feel free to add your name, github profile and a little bit about yourself inside the "contributors" file inside this repo. If you'd like to add your linkedin that's allowed as well.

Well Let's get started... This one is easy...fix the typos :)

### Clues
Here are some typos that I included in this sample README file:

    "To install this project, simply clone the repository and run npm install." (should be "simply clone the repository and run npm install")
    "To use this project, run npm start and follow the on-screen prompts." (should be "To use this project, run npm start and follow the on-screen prompts.")
    "If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:" (should be "If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:")
    "Please note that all contributions must follow our code of conduct." (should be "Please note that all contributions must follow our code of conduct.")
    "This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant." (should be "This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant.")
    "Please report unacceptable behavior to email@example.com." (should be "Please report unacceptable behavior to email@example.com.")
    "This project was created by Your Name." (should be "This project was created by Your Name.")
    "This project is licensed under the MIT License." (should be "This project is licensed under the MIT License.")
